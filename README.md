# Models and Data for prediction of &Delta;&Delta;G
All of the models and data utilized for the experiments carried out in [Improving ΔΔG predictions with a multi-task convolutional Siamese Network](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01497).

Data can be found in `BindingDB_data`

All models and scripts to train and evaluate models can be found in `python_files`

Fully trained models can be found in `trained_models/`

Figures used in the paper are in `figs/`, these were generated using the `PaperFigures.ipynb` notebook.

`external_test/` contains all of the external datasets that were used to evaluate generalizability of the model and compare to Jimenez _et al._
