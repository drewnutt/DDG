# Models and Data for prediction of $\Delta\Delta G$

Data can be found in `new_Prot_Lig_Valid/`

All models and scripts to train and evaluate models can be found in `python_files`

Fully trained models can be found in `models/`

Figures used in the paper are in `figs/`, these were generated using the `PaperFigures.ipynb` notebook.

`GNINA_RUN/` contains a pipeline and results for computing $\Delta\Delta G$ with the trained GNINA models.

`external_test/` contains all of the external datasets that were used to evaluate generalizability of the model and compare to Jimenez _et. al_
