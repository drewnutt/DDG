# Python Scripts for Training and Analysis

This directory contains all of the python scripts used for the training and analysis of the &Delta;&Delta;G models  

Directory contents:
- `ddg_reg_ptrain_siamese.py` - Main python training script for &Delta;&Delta;G models
- `*_model.py` - PyTorch model files for the &Delta;&Delta;G models used in the paper


## Model Files
Model files are named with what convolutional architecture they use for their siamese arms, `dense` or `def2018`.
